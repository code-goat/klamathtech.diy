Simply discarding hard drives or computers may leave data vulnerable to recovery. Our service ensures complete and irreversible data erasure through a standardized, technically robust process.\nTechnical Process Workflow # Device Intake and Preparation\nClients submit computers, hard drives, or solid-state drives for secure erasure. Devices are cataloged and prepared for processing.\nBooting a Secure Erasure Environment\nEach device is started using a dedicated, open-source data destruction environment.1 This environment operates independently of the device‚Äôs original operating system, reducing the risk of residual data access.\nSelection of Erasure Protocol\nThe appropriate erasure protocol is chosen based on device type and client requirements. Available methods include:\nMulti-pass overwriting (e.g., Department of Defense 5220.22-M, RCMP, Gutmann)2 Hardware-based commands such as Sanitize or Security Erase for supported drives\nThese protocols are recognized by industry and government standards for secure data destruction. Data Overwrite and Validation\nThe selected protocol overwrites all addressable sectors on the storage device. Upon completion, the system performs a verification pass to confirm that no readable data remains.3 This validation step is essential for ensuring compliance with data privacy requirements.\nDocumentation and Certification\nAfter successful erasure and verification, clients receive a detailed certificate. This document specifies the device, the erasure method used, and confirmation of process completion. Certification provides clients with auditable proof of secure data handling.\nService Advantages # Standards-Based Technical Approach:\nAll processes adhere to recognized data sanitization standards, ensuring regulatory compliance and best practices.\nTransparency:\nThe erasure environment is open source, allowing for independent review of methods and results.\nOn-Premises Processing:\nAll data erasure occurs on-site or in the presence of the client, ensuring that data never leaves their control.\nComprehensive Documentation:\nClients receive full documentation for legal, regulatory, or internal policy requirements.\nProtect your privacy and the community-let us help you recycle, donate, or dispose of your devices safely and securely.\nShredOS.x86_64 GitHub Project \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMedia Sanitization Procedure ‚Äì George Mason University IT Security \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nShredOS/README.md at master ‚Äì GitHub \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/secure-shred/","section":"Community Projects","summary":"","title":"Secure Data Erasure Service","type":"projects"},{"content":" Reclaiming Old Tech in the Klamath Bioregion # UpRiv|Upcycle is the Klamath Tech Collective‚Äôs initiative to intercept and upcycle e-waste-unused, upgraded, or unsupported computers-before they end up in the landfill.

Our collective is a hub for building digital autonomy, learning new digital tools and demystifying technologies such as AI by helping our bioregion move beyond hype and toward genuine empowerment.\nCommunity Debunking \u0026amp; Digital Defense:\nWe provide a safe and accessible space for critical conversations around technology, AI, digital rights, and data sovereignty. Our workshops and resources help community members spot misinformation, understand risks, and make informed choices about the tech in their lives.\nOur Values # Bioregional Stewardship:\nWe believe the bioregion is the natural scale for collective action and governance, aligning technology with the needs of land and people.\nIntergenerational Learning:\nWe foster relationships between youth, elders, and all community members, centering Indigenous ways of knowing and ensuring everyone has a voice in shaping our digital future.\nCollective Power:\nWe work to build local infrastructure and knowledge that liberates our communities from corporate and colonial control, nurturing a new generation of tech stewards and citizen scientists.\nSome Guiding Ideas\u0026hellip; # We take inspiration from many places and people. One notable contribution has been the ideas presented by Marisa Elena Duarte:\nHuman beings are also herd animals. They are capable of organizing beyond the level of the individual. They orchestrate activity at the level of a community, and articulate their identities based on geopolitical locations and status. En masse, they become swept up in communal systems of belief.\nHuman beings are inherently creative. They create systems and structures in this world through the use of tools. The physical menifestation of these systems and structures reflects human beliefs over time.\nThe present-day use of the word technology is laden with present-day beliefs about prgress, scientific and ethical advance through computing, and the superhuman conquest of time, space, history and environment. There is a belief that being able to speak in code\u0026ndash;that is, programming code\u0026ndash;parallels the decoding of the human genome and the dark matter of the multiverse, and that somehow this process of coding and decoding is meaningful for all mankind. These beliefs derive from Western European Enlightenment history of ideas. Like a magic bullet, the word information can at once comprise programming code, genetic code, and the nearly immeasurable mass that one nanoparticle passes off to another when they collide in the vacuum between all other known and measurable subatomic particles.\nThe large-scale forces of Western European modernities have resulted in the creation of a global class of humans referred to as \u0026ldquo;natives,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;aboriginals,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;indigenous\u0026rdquo; persons. Across modern nation-states, that nomenclature refers to a historiographical moment, when nation-state authorities were charged with classifying all resident human beings as subjects or nonsubjects, citizens or noncitizens, slaves or workers, and so on. The words Native American, Aboriginal, and Indigenous are embedded with a tension of belonging and yet not belonging to the modern nation-state. For an American Indian, it is to be called by all non-Natives an alien within one\u0026rsquo;s own territory, in the shadows of one\u0026rsquo;s own grandmother mountains.\nVarious fields of science are at present dominated by those who believe that techno-scientific advance must come from a Western European history of ideas and not from, for example, Tsalagi histories of ideas, Haiki histories of ideas, A:Shiwi histories of ideas, Anishinaabe histories of ideas, Chamoru histories of ideas, and the like. Only recently have a few scientists working in their universities come to agree that Native ways of knowing compose a source of scientific understanding. \u0026ldquo;Native ways of knowing,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Indigenous knowledge,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Native systems of knowledge\u0026rdquo;\u0026ndash;all these phrases refer to a complexity of understanding about the nature of the human universe. As scientists\u0026ndash;and especially as information scientists\u0026ndash;we are only at the beginning of our understanding.\nMarisa Elena Duarte, Network Sovereignty Are you interested in weaving together ancestral wisdom and modern tools, forging a path toward digital sovereignty and bioregional resilience-where technology flows with, not against, the river?

This movement, Neo-Luddism, echoes the spirit of the original Luddites: skilled workers who, in the early 19th century England, rebelled not against technology itself, but against the way it was used to undermine their rights and livelihoods123. Today, Neo-Ludditism challenges the unchecked power of tech giants, fighting to reclaim agency, dignity, and justice in a world increasingly ruled by algorithms and data extraction.\nWhat is Neo-Luddism? # Neo-Luddism is not simply a rejection of all technology. Instead, it is a critical stance against technologies and systems that alienate, exploit, or surveil us451. Modern Neo-Luddites come from all walks of life: environmentalists, privacy advocates, technologists, artists, and even teenagers who choose to live without smartphones or social media1. Their common thread is a refusal to be passive consumers or digital peasants in a world where a handful of corporations act as feudal lords, extracting value from our data, attention, and labor51.\nAs with the original Luddites, today‚Äôs Neo-Luddite movement is not simply about smashing machines, but about questioning who technology serves, who it harms, and how it shapes our lives. It is a call for emancipation from technological systems that diminish our autonomy and well-being412.\nTechnofeudalism and Technocolonialism: The New Digital Order # Technofeudalism\nIn this digital era, power is concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants-Google, Amazon, Meta, Apple-who control the ‚Äúcloud capital‚Äù that underpins modern life. These corporations don‚Äôt just sell products; they collect ‚Äúdigital rent‚Äù by harvesting our data, shaping our behavior, and setting the rules of the digital realm. The more that state and corporate technology systems fuse together, the more we become ‚Äúdigital peasants,‚Äù dependent on their platforms for economic and basic social and civil participation513.\nTechnocolonialism\nThis new order mirrors the old logic of colonialism, but on a digital frontier. Global tech companies, mainly from the Global North, dominate the technological infrastructure and data flows of the world. This creates new forms of dependency and exploitation, especially for the Global South, deepening inequalities and privatizing governance678. The result is a world where tech giants act as quasi-sovereign powers, shaping societies and economies to serve their interests.\nLessons from the Original Luddites # The Luddites of the 19th century were not anti-technology; they were pro-worker, pro-community, and pro-justice. They resisted machines only when those machines were used to erode their livelihoods and concentrate power in the hands of factory owners. Their struggle was about who controls technology and for whose benefit192.\nToday, our digital tools-social media, cloud platforms, smartphones-are the new looms. They extract value from us, often without fair compensation or control. But unlike the machinery of the past, these tools are woven into the fabric of our daily lives, making resistance more complex but no less necessary.\nModern Neo-Luddite Resistance: Digital Literacy and Collective Power # Critical Reflection and Epistemological Luddism\nNeo-Luddism today is about more than just opting out. It‚Äôs about critical reflection-questioning the role of technology in our lives and society, and sometimes dismantling or unplugging systems to create space for learning and autonomy12. This ‚Äúepistemological Luddism‚Äù empowers us to evaluate whether a technology is appropriate for its time and place, and to imagine new ways of living and working with (or without) digital tools.\nDigital Literacy as a Shield\nUnderstanding how platforms collect and use our data, how algorithms shape our choices, and how digital monopolies operate is the first step toward empowerment. Digital literacy enables us to:\nRecognize manipulative design and resist addictive features. Use privacy-focused tools and encryption to protect our data. Support open-source and decentralized technologies that put users, not corporations, in control. Community and Collective Action\nNeo-Luddism is not just about individual escape, but about building collective power. By learning together, sharing knowledge, and organizing for our rights, we can challenge the dominance of digital lords. This means:\nBuilding and participating in digital cooperatives and grassroots tech initiatives. Demanding transparency, accountability, and fair policies from tech companies and governments. Advocating for digital rights, data sovereignty, and fair digital labor practices. Reclaiming Technology as a Tool for Liberation # The ultimate goal is not to reject technology, but to ensure it serves us-not the other way around. As Cory Doctorow and other digital rights advocates argue, we must demand that technology amplifies our voices, protects our rights, and empowers our communities. This requires:\nEducating ourselves and others about digital justice. Supporting movements and policies that prioritize user empowerment over corporate profit. Reimagining technology as a tool for collective good, not just private gain. Conclusion: The New Peasant Revolt # The digital landscape may be dominated by new lords and old patterns of exploitation, but history shows that resistance is possible-and powerful. Like the Luddites, we must organize, educate, and demand justice. By fostering digital literacy and building community, we can reclaim our agency, protect our privacy, and transform technology from a tool of domination into a force for liberation and equity.\nNeo-Luddism is the new peasant revolt-a movement to ensure that technology serves humanity, not the other way around.\nReferences # Find Out More\u0026hellip; # https://gizmodo.com/the-many-faces-of-Neo-luddism-1682139778 https://kottke.org/24/03/the-Neo-luddite-movement The New Luddites - Digital Architecture Lab, 2025.\nhttps://dalab.xyz/en/blog/the-new-luddites/ \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAgainst Technology: From the Luddites to Neo-Luddism, Steven E.

At its core, technocolonialism describes how powerful tech corporations, mostly based in the Global North, use digital infrastructure, data, and artificial intelligence to entrench inequities, reinforce dependency, and impose their cultural and economic will on the Global South and marginalized communities everywhere123.\nJust as Empire claims land, resources, and sovereignty through conquest and settlement, today‚Äôs tech giants claim digital ‚Äúterritory‚Äù by building and controlling the platforms, data streams, and digital ecosystems that underpin daily life34. This is not just about economic power, but about shaping the very ways people communicate, learn, work, and even imagine their futures.\nSettler Colonialism and Digital Infrastructures # The colonialization of the Americas was not only about resource extraction, but also about settler colonialism: the establishment of new social, economic, and political orders by displacing and dominating Indigenous populations. Settlers imposed their languages, laws, and cultures, often erasing or marginalizing existing ways of life.\nTechnocolonialism mirrors this process in the digital realm. Tech corporations ‚Äúsettle‚Äù new markets by rolling out infrastructure (like cloud services, social networks, and mobile platforms) that become essential for participation in modern society. Local alternatives are often crowded out or rendered obsolete, and communities become dependent on foreign technologies for basic communication, commerce, and governance234. The ‚Äúsettlers‚Äù in this case are not nessecarily people, but captivating devices, platforms and proprietary standards, embedding the values and interests of their creators.\nExtraction, Dependency, and Cultural Imperialism # Colonial empires extracted wealth-gold, silver, crops, labor-while creating systems of dependency that kept colonies subordinate. Similarly, technocolonialism is marked by the extraction of data, attention, and digital labor, with profits flowing to distant corporate centers. The dependency is deepened as countries, especially in the Global South, rely on imported software, hardware, and AI systems, making it nearly impossible to develop independent digital economies or protect local interests34.\nCultural imperialism is also central. Just as colonizers imposed their languages and worldviews, tech companies export the cultural norms, biases, and epistemologies of Silicon Valley-often English-language interfaces, Western-centric values, and data-driven ways of knowing-crowding out local cultures and alternative ways of organizing knowledge and society3.\nLabor, Surveillance, and Experimentation # Colonial powers often treated colonized lands as laboratories for experimentation, whether in agriculture, governance, or medicine-frequently with devastating consequences for local populations. In the digital age, technocolonialism sees marginalized communities and the Global South becoming sites for technological ‚Äúpilots‚Äù: biometric surveillance in refugee camps, AI-driven humanitarian programs, and new forms of digital identification516. These experiments are justified as ‚Äúprogress‚Äù or ‚Äúaid,‚Äù but often reinforce power asymmetries and expose vulnerable populations to new risks1.\nThe New Digital Frontier # Much as the colonial powers justified their actions with rhetoric about ‚Äúcivilizing missions‚Äù and ‚Äúprogress,‚Äù today‚Äôs tech empires claim to be connecting the world, fostering development, and empowering the underserved. But beneath this benevolent veneer lies a system that perpetuates extraction, dependency, and cultural erasure-echoing the very dynamics of settler colonialism and imperial conquest13.\nTo resist technocolonialism is to demand digital self-determination: the right of communities to control their own data, infrastructures, and technological futures. It is a call to decolonize the digital world, challenge extractive practices, and build technologies that serve the needs and values of all peoples-not just the interests of distant digital empires.789101112\nTechnocolonialism: When Technology for Good is Harmful | Wiley \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Road to Technocolonialism \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAn intellectual history of digital colonialism - Oxford Academic \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Economics of Techno-Colonialism - NEXTWITS \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nDigital Innovation and Data Practices in the Humanitarian Response \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTechnocolonialism and biometrics: reinvigorating the call to \u0026hellip; \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIndigenous Knowledge, Western Science, and the US Colonial Project \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nKeeping Indigenous Science Knowledge out of a Colonial Mold (Eos) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nColonial Science, Technoscience, and Indigenous Knowledge (Chambers, PDF) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nColonialism and Science (University of Glasgow, PDF) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nConfronting colonial history: toward healing, just, and equitable conservation (Ecology \u0026amp; Society) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMÃì·πá√∫xv îit model for centering Indigenous knowledge and governance (PMC) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/technocolonialism/","section":"Info / Writings","summary":"","title":"Technocolonialism: Digital Empires and the Legacy of Colonialism","type":"info"},{"content":" The Positive History and Ethic of Hacker Culture # The Origins of Hacker Culture # Hacker culture began long before the age of personal computers, rooted in curiosity, creativity, and the desire to understand and improve complex systems. The earliest \u0026ldquo;hackers\u0026rdquo; were not digital criminals, but tinkerers and problem-solvers. In the late 19th century, young telephone operators were known to play pranks by switching lines, demonstrating the first playful exploits of technical systems. By the mid-20th century, the term \u0026ldquo;hacker\u0026rdquo; emerged at MIT, not in computer labs, but among students modifying model train sets for fun and challenge. This spirit of exploration soon transferred to mainframe computers, where early hackers at MIT and other institutions developed a culture centered on intellectual curiosity, sharing, and the belief that information should be accessible and improvable by anyone willing to learn.12\nThe Original Definition of a Hacker # Originally, a \u0026ldquo;hacker\u0026rdquo; was someone who delighted in exploring the limits of what was possible, repurposing technology in creative ways, and sharing their findings with others. Hackers saw technology as a playground for ingenuity, not a weapon for harm. This ethic was rooted in openness, transparency, and the joy of collective problem-solving. The early hacker communities valued cleverness, resourcefulness, and the free exchange of ideas, often working collaboratively to push the boundaries of hardware and software.34\nThe Hacker Manifesto # A pivotal moment in hacker culture came in 1986 with the publication of \u0026ldquo;The Hacker Manifesto\u0026rdquo; (also known as \u0026ldquo;The Conscience of a Hacker\u0026rdquo;) by Loyd Blankenship, aka The Mentor. Written after his arrest, the manifesto articulated the mindset of hackers as explorers, not criminals:\n\u0026ldquo;We explore\u0026hellip; and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge\u0026hellip; and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias\u0026hellip; and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it\u0026rsquo;s for our own good, yet we\u0026rsquo;re the criminals.\u0026rdquo;\nThe manifesto championed the idea that hacking was about curiosity, learning, and the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake-a positive, even utopian, vision of what technology and community could become.5\nThe Ethic of the Free Software Movement # The positive hacker ethic found its most enduring expression in the Free Software Movement, formally launched by Richard Stallman in 1983 with the GNU Project. Stallman and his peers believed that software should be free-not just in price, but in freedom: the freedom to run, study, modify, and share it. This philosophy was a direct response to the increasing privatization and secrecy in the software industry, which Stallman saw as a threat to the collaborative, open culture that had defined early computing.\nThe movement‚Äôs foundational document, the GNU Manifesto, argued that proprietary software undermined both technical progress and community. The Free Software Foundation, established in 1985, promoted these ideals and developed legal tools like the GNU General Public License (GPL) and the concept of \u0026ldquo;copyleft,\u0026rdquo; ensuring that software and its derivatives would always remain free and open.678\nDIY Culture and Collective Empowerment # Hacker culture has always overlapped with the broader Do-It-Yourself (DIY) ethos: the belief that anyone can learn, build, and repair technology themselves. This spirit is evident in everything from early computer clubs and bulletin board systems to modern makerspaces and open-source hardware projects. DIY culture rejects passive consumption in favor of active participation and learning by doing.\nAt its best, hacker culture is about collective empowerment through shared knowledge. Hackers, free software advocates, and DIYers believe that technology should be a tool for liberation, not control. They champion transparency, accessibility, and the idea that everyone should have the means to shape their own digital destiny. This ethic has inspired generations of programmers, activists, and hobbyists to collaborate on projects that benefit the wider community, from Linux and Wikipedia to Creative Commons and beyond.910\nConclusion # The positive history of hacker culture is a story of curiosity, openness, and the transformative power of shared knowledge. From the playful tinkerers of MIT to the idealists of the Free Software Movement, hackers have shown that technology can be a force for collective good-when it is open, accessible, and shaped by the many, not the few.\nA Brief History of Hacking \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHow Did Hacker Culture Originate? \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nLegendary Groups That Shaped Hacker Culture \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCybersecurity: The History of Hacking and Data Breaches \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Hacker Manifesto (The Mentor) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFree Software Movement - Wikipedia \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHow Did Free Software Build a Social Movement? \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nHistory of Free and Open-Source Software - Wikipedia \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFOSS Movements, Digital Rebellion (PDF) \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nFree Software Philosophy - Bellevue College \u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/hacker_manifesto/","section":"Info / Writings","summary":"","title":"The History of Hacker Culture","type":"info"},{"content":" What is \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo;? # \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; is a movement and rallying cry for Indigenous peoples to reclaim authority over their own data, paralleling calls for #LandBack and #CashBack. At its core, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; demands that data about Indigenous communities, cultures, languages, and lands-regardless of how or when it was collected-rightfully belongs to those communities and must be governed by them.\nKey Principles # Indigenous Data Sovereignty:\n\u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; is rooted in the principle of Indigenous Data Sovereignty: the right of Indigenous nations to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their own data. This means Indigenous peoples should control how their data is collected, stored, accessed, and used, in alignment with their values and worldviews.\nResponse to Extractive Practices:\nThe movement is a reaction against extractive, colonial systems that have historically commodified and profited from Indigenous knowledge, culture, and information-often without consent or benefit to the communities themselves.\nCultural Revitalization:\nBeyond resistance, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; inspires the rejuvenation of Indigenous cultures by supporting the protection and revitalization of language, traditions, and knowledge systems through community-controlled data practices.\nGuiding Ethos # ‚ÄúNothing about us without us.‚Äù\nThis phrase captures the essence of the movement: Indigenous peoples must be at the center of all decisions about their data. Internationally, this is supported by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Article 31, which affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain, control, protect, and develop their cultural knowledge and data.\nWhy It Matters # Restoring Authority:\n\u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; seeks to reverse centuries of data colonialism by restoring authority to Indigenous communities over their information and representation.\nEthical Data Governance:\nThe movement calls for data governance models that prioritize Indigenous consent, benefit, and stewardship, challenging Western-centric and extractive approaches.\nCommunity Digital Literacy and Data Privacy:\nTeaching digital literacy and data privacy practices is essential to the \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; movement. By equipping community members with the skills to understand, protect, and manage their own data, we empower Indigenous peoples to safeguard their information, resist digital exploitation, and make informed choices about technology. This education helps ensure that data sovereignty is not just a principle, but a lived reality-enabling communities to actively defend their rights and shape their digital futures.\nIn summary, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; is about returning control of data to Indigenous peoples, ensuring it is managed, shared, and used on their terms, for their benefit, and in accordance with their cultural values and rights.\n#DataBack Find Out More\u0026hellip; # https://animikii.com/insights/databack-recognize-and-reclaim-indigenous-data-sovereignty https://databack.animikii.com/ https://www.idsovandresearcher.com/ https://usindigenousdatanetwork.org/ Examples # https://www.sentinelsnetwork.com/ https://www.indigenousmaps.com/ ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/data_back/","section":"Info / Writings","summary":"","title":"What is 'Data Back'?","type":"info"},{"content":" A feminist server stack is a concept and practice that applies intersectional feminist principles to every layer of digital infrastructure-from hardware and software to governance, community, and care. It‚Äôs not just about who runs the server, but how and why it‚Äôs run, and for whom.\nCore Principles and Features # Intersectional and Inclusive Design\nA feminist server stack is intentionally designed to center the needs, voices, and participation of women, queer, trans, and other marginalized people in tech. It challenges the default settings, hierarchies, and exclusions of mainstream digital infrastructure by embedding anti-racist, anti-capitalist, queer, and decolonial values throughout the stack-not just at the user interface, but all the way down to the code and hardware.\nCommunity Ownership \u0026amp; Autonomy\nThese servers are collectively owned, managed, and governed by their communities, not by corporations or distant administrators. They aim for autonomy over data, privacy, and digital resources, resisting surveillance and centralized control.\nCare, Consent, and Safe(r) Spaces\nA feminist server is as much about relationships as it is about technology. It foregrounds care, mutual support, and consent-creating digital spaces that are safer from harassment, violence, and exploitation, and where learning and technical skill-sharing are accessible to all.\nTransparency and Process\nRather than hiding complexity or pretending to be ‚Äúseamless,‚Äù feminist servers value openness about how things work, who is involved, and what the limits and vulnerabilities are. They encourage learning, documentation, and collective troubleshooting.\nSustainability and Scale\nFeminist servers often intentionally avoid the ‚Äúbigger, faster, more‚Äù logic of mainstream tech. They may run on recycled hardware, use low-energy setups (like Raspberry Pi clusters), and prioritize local, sustainable, or small-scale operations over global reach.\nExperimentation and Resistance\nThese stacks are spaces for experimentation-testing new ways of organizing digital life that resist patriarchal, capitalist, and colonial norms. They might host alternative social media, archives \u0026amp; documentation, encrypted chat, or other tools for community empowerment and mutual aid.\nExample Manifesto Points # (from the Feminist Server Manifesto )\nIs a situated technology, aware of its context and ecology. Is run for and by a caring community. Opens up processes, tools, and habits to scrutiny and learning. Radically questions the conditions for serving and service. Is autonomous, deciding its own dependencies. Faces freedom and vulnerability together. In Practice # A feminist server stack might look like:\nA collectively managed server running open-source software, governed by conventionally marganialized people. Hardware sourced from e-waste or low-energy devices, physically located in the community it serves. Encrypted, privacy-respecting services (chat, file-sharing, websites) with clear community guidelines and transparent moderation. Documentation, onboarding, and technical skill-sharing prioritized for all members. A refusal to scale up for profit or surveillance, focusing instead on care, sustainability, and empowerment. In short:\nA feminist server stack is an act of technological resistance and imagination-a way to reclaim digital infrastructure as a site of empowerment, care, and collective liberation, rather than domination or exclusion.\nReferences # Defining Full Stack Feminism - PubPub Co-designing feminist web servers to reimagine Internet futures Feminist server | Feminist Tech Exchange Platform (FTX) The (Im)possibility of Autonomous Feminist Infrastructure Inhabiting affective infrastructures: How not to scale a feminist video \u0026hellip; ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/femme_srv/","section":"Info / Writings","summary":"","title":"What is a 'Feminist Server Stack'?","type":"info"},{"content":" This would be a Privacy Guide # You know? # Like this! # ","date":"Apr 16, 16160","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guides/privacy101/2-browser/","section":"Guides","summary":"","title":"1.02 Internet Browser","type":"guides"},{"content":" This would be a Privacy Guide # You know? # Like this! # ","date":"Apr 16, 16160","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guides/privacy101/3-search/","section":"Guides","summary":"","title":"1.03 Search Engine","type":"guides"},{"content":" This would be guide about Password Managers # You know? # Like this! # ","date":"Apr 20, 20200","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guides/privacy101/4-password_manager/","section":"Guides","summary":"","title":"1.04 Password Manager","type":"guides"},{"content":" This would be a Privacy Guide # You know? # Like this! # ","date":"Apr 16, 16160","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guides/privacy101/5-email/","section":"Guides","summary":"","title":"1.05 Email","type":"guides"},{"content":" This would be a Privacy Guide # You know? # Like this! # ","date":"Apr 16, 16160","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/guides/privacy101/6-messaging/","section":"Guides","summary":"","title":"1.06 Messaging","type":"guides"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/about/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"About","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Community Projects","summary":"","title":"Community Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/","section":"Info / Writings","summary":"","title":"Info / Writings","type":"info"},{"content":" ATTENTION: # üõ†Ô∏è This site is under active developement.
