This landscape is often described as technofeudalism, a system where tech giants act as modern feudal lords, controlling vast digital territories and extracting value from users through data and algorithmic control. To understand this complex system, let\u0026rsquo;s delve into its core components and explore historical parallels that can guide us toward a more equitable future.\nDefining Technofeudalism / Techno-colonization # Technofeudalism represents a post-capitalist structure where power is concentrated in platform ownership and data extraction rather than traditional capital. This system is characterized by cloud capital, where digital infrastructure serves as the new \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; monopolized by tech corporations. Instead of generating profits through production, these corporations extract what can be thought of as cloud rent, such as ad revenue and data fees. In this setup, users and workers become digital peasants, reliant on platforms for economic and social participation. The necessity of having a smartphone to fully engage in society underscores this dependency, making it difficult to imagine life without these digital tools.\nIn parallel, technocolonialism emerges as a modern iteration of colonialism, where control over technology infrastructure, data, and digital ecosystems is concentrated in the hands of a few global tech corporations, predominantly based in the Global North. This domination mirrors traditional colonialism, where economic, political, and cultural power was concentrated in the hands of a few nations, to the detriment of others. Technocolonialism involves the exploitation of digital technologies for political, economic, and social domination, often resulting in an unequal division of labor and dependency on digital infrastructure. It further exacerbates the disparities between the Global North and South, as developing countries become reliant on foreign technologies and data extraction systems, reinforcing their subordinate position in the global digital economy. Both technofeudalism and technocolonialism highlight how digital technologies can be used to exert control and influence over populations and resources, often in ways that mirror historical forms of exploitation.\nTechnofuedalism # Historical Context: The Luddite Revolution # An interesting parallel to our current situation is the Luddite Revolution in Western Europe during the early 19th century. Often misunderstood as anti-technology, the Luddites were actually pro-worker rights activists who targeted machinery that undermined their livelihoods. Between 1811 and 1816, they organized raids to destroy textile machinery, not because they opposed technology itself, but because these machines were used to exploit workers by reducing wages and increasing unemployment. The Luddites sought fair wages, safer working conditions, and protection against displacement by machines.\nParallels Between Technofeudalism and Industrial Exploitation # Today, we face a similar challenge. Our smartphones, the internet, browsers, and social media platforms are the modern equivalents of those textile machines. These technologies extract value from us—our data, attention, and labor—often without fair compensation or control over how they are used. Just as the Luddites smashed looms to reclaim their agency, we must find ways to resist the extractive forces of technofeudalism. However, unlike the physical machinery of the past, digital tools are deeply embedded in our daily lives, making traditional forms of resistance impractical.\nModern Resistance: Digital Literacy as Defense # In this digital age, digital literacy becomes our most powerful tool for resistance. It involves understanding how data is extracted, how algorithms work, and how platform monopolies operate. By being aware of these dynamics, we can begin to reclaim our agency. Digital literacy empowers us to use technology in ways that serve us, rather than just serving the interests of tech corporations. This might involve using encryption to protect our data, supporting open-source software, or advocating for policies that promote digital rights and fairness.\nConclusion: Reclaiming Agency in a Technofeudal Era # As we navigate this complex digital landscape, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to remember that our goal is not to reject technology, but to ensure it serves humanity rather than just profit. Like the Luddites, we must focus on justice—demanding that technology empowers workers and users, not just the corporations that control it. By educating ourselves, advocating for policy reforms, and supporting grassroots tech initiatives, we can dismantle the extractive systems of technofeudalism and build a more equitable digital future. This journey requires collective action and a commitment to using technology as a tool for empowerment, rather than exploitation.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/technofeudalism/","section":"Docs","summary":"","title":"'Technofeudalism \u0026 Technocolonialism' What are they?","type":"info"},{"content":" We are salmon swimming upstream against the currents of technocolonialism # Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hoopa territories \u0026ndash; From Happy Camp to Hoopa, from Katamin to Kepel \u0026ndash; we’re building community-owned tech ecosystems where the Klamath meets the keyboard.\nThe Klamath Tech Collective is a bioregional tech collective dedicated to shrinking the tech literacy gap and reclaiming technology as a tool for community resilience, self-determination, and regeneration.

At its core, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; demands that data about Indigenous communities, cultures, languages, and lands-regardless of how or when it was collected-rightfully belongs to those communities and must be governed by them.\nKey Principles # Indigenous Data Sovereignty:\n\u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; is rooted in the principle of Indigenous Data Sovereignty: the right of Indigenous nations to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their own data. This means Indigenous peoples should control how their data is collected, stored, accessed, and used, in alignment with their values and worldviews.\nResponse to Extractive Practices:\nThe movement is a reaction against extractive, colonial systems that have historically commodified and profited from Indigenous knowledge, culture, and information-often without consent or benefit to the communities themselves.\nCultural Revitalization:\nBeyond resistance, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; inspires the rejuvenation of Indigenous cultures by supporting the protection and revitalization of language, traditions, and knowledge systems through community-controlled data practices.\nGuiding Ethos # “Nothing about us without us.”\nThis phrase captures the essence of the movement: Indigenous peoples must be at the center of all decisions about their data. Internationally, this is supported by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Article 31, which affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain, control, protect, and develop their cultural knowledge and data.\nWhy It Matters # Restoring Authority:\n\u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; seeks to reverse centuries of data colonialism by restoring authority to Indigenous communities over their information and representation.\nEthical Data Governance:\nThe movement calls for data governance models that prioritize Indigenous consent, benefit, and stewardship, challenging Western-centric and extractive approaches.\nCommunity Digital Literacy and Data Privacy:\nTeaching digital literacy and data privacy practices is essential to the \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; movement. By equipping community members with the skills to understand, protect, and manage their own data, we empower Indigenous peoples to safeguard their information, resist digital exploitation, and make informed choices about technology. This education helps ensure that data sovereignty is not just a principle, but a lived reality-enabling communities to actively defend their rights and shape their digital futures.\nIn summary, \u0026ldquo;Data Back\u0026rdquo; is about returning control of data to Indigenous peoples, ensuring it is managed, shared, and used on their terms, for their benefit, and in accordance with their cultural values and rights.\nFind Out More\u0026hellip; # https://animikii.com/insights/databack-recognize-and-reclaim-indigenous-data-sovereignty https://databack.animikii.com/ https://www.idsovandresearcher.com/ https://usindigenousdatanetwork.org/ Examples # https://www.sentinelsnetwork.com/ https://www.indigenousmaps.com/ ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/info/data_back/","section":"Docs","summary":"","title":"What is 'Data Back'?","type":"info"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/about/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"About","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/docs/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Docs","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/documentation/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Documentation","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"May 4, 4040","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/fern/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Fern","type":"authors"},{"content":"\rAncient Greece: Privacy was valued in ancient Greek culture, with concepts like \"oikonomia\" emphasizing the importance of private life.\r1789: The U.S. Constitution came into effect, providing implicit protections for privacy through its amendments.\r1890: The \"Right to Privacy\" law review article by Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren argued for a legal right to privacy.\r1914: The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was established, later becoming a key player in privacy enforcement.\r1970s: The U.S. government began regulating encryption as a munition, restricting its export and use.\r1973: The HEW Advisory Committee on Automated Personal Data Systems developed Fair Information Practices, which influenced modern privacy legislation.\r1974: The Privacy Act of 1974 and FERPA were enacted to protect personal data.\r1975: The draft Data Encryption Standard (DES) was published, marking a significant step in public cryptography.\r1977: DES was adopted as a federal standard, despite concerns about its security.\r1980s: Early malware and viruses began to spread, highlighting cybersecurity concerns.\r1990s: Encryption export controls were gradually relaxed due to lobbying and economic needs.\r1995: The EU Data Protection Directive was adopted, setting a precedent for robust privacy laws.\r1996: HIPAA was enacted to protect health information.\r1998: COPPA was passed to safeguard children's online privacy.\r1999: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act required financial institutions to disclose data sharing practices.\r2000: Encryption regulations were significantly relaxed in the U.S.\r2001: AES replaced DES as the encryption standard.\r2010s:\r2012: Target's marketing practices raised privacy concerns.\r2013: Edward Snowden revealed extensive government surveillance, sparking global privacy debates.\r2013: The Target data breach exposed millions of credit card details.\r2014: The Sony Pictures hack highlighted cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\r2015: The Safe Harbor agreement was invalidated, impacting data transfers between the EU and U.S.\r2018: GDPR came into effect, setting new standards for data protection.\r2018: The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal exposed misuse of personal data.\r2020s:\r2020: CCPA took effect in California, mirroring GDPR protections.\r2021: Apple introduced App Tracking Transparency, enhancing user privacy controls.\r2021: Facebook faced criticism over WhatsApp data sharing practices.\r2022: The U.S. government faced challenges in balancing privacy with surveillance needs.\rHistorical Regulation: Encryption was once regulated as a munition, with export restrictions that treated it as a weapon.\rForced Disclosure Laws: Some countries have laws requiring individuals to disclose encryption keys during investigations.\rLegal Debates: Cases like United States v.
