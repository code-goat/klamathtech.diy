# Klamath Tech Collective: Points of Unity

## 1. Community Empowerment
We believe technology should serve and uplift our local communities-especially those historically marginalized or underserved. We strive to use our skills and resources to address real needs, foster local resilience, and support grassroots initiatives.

## 2. Cooperation Over Competition
We are committed to a cooperative, non-hierarchical approach. We value mutual aid, knowledge sharing, and collective decision-making over individualism and competition.

## 3. Tech for Liberation, Not Domination
We oppose the use of technology for surveillance, exploitation, or control. We are dedicated to building and supporting tools and practices that protect privacy, autonomy, and freedom for all.

## 4. Justice and Inclusion
We recognize and challenge the ways in which technology can reinforce social, economic, and environmental injustice. We actively work to dismantle barriers to participation in tech, and we center the voices and leadership of Indigenous, Black, and other marginalized peoples in our work.

## 5. Respect for Indigenous Knowledge and Land
We acknowledge that we live and work on the ancestral lands of the Klamath, Yurok, Karuk, Hoopa, Modoc, and other Indigenous peoples. We commit to learning from, supporting, and respecting Indigenous sovereignty, traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and ongoing struggles for justice.

## 6. Transparency and Accountability
We operate with transparency in our processes, finances, and decision-making. We hold ourselves accountable to our values, to each other, and to the broader community.

## 7. Free/Libre and Open Source Principles
We support the use and development of free/libre and open source software and hardware. We believe knowledge and technology should be accessible, modifiable, and shareable by all.

## 8. Environmental Responsibility
We recognize the environmental impact of technology and strive to minimize harm. We support sustainable practices, repair and reuse, and tech that strengthens our relationship with the land and water.

## 9. Continuous Learning and Collective Growth
We foster a culture of curiosity, humility, and collective learning. We share skills, mentor each other, and grow together as technologists and as people.

## 10. Solidarity and Mutual Aid
We stand in solidarity with other movements for justice, equity, and liberation-locally and globally. We practice mutual aid, sharing resources and support within and beyond our collective.

*These Points of Unity are a living document. We will revisit, revise, and reaffirm them together as our collective and our community grow and change.*
