## What is "Data Back"?

**"Data Back"** is a movement and rallying cry for Indigenous peoples to reclaim authority over their own data, paralleling calls for **#LandBack** and **#CashBack**. At its core, **"Data Back"** demands that data about Indigenous communities, cultures, languages, and lands-regardless of how or when it was collected-rightfully belongs to those communities and must be governed by them.

### Key Principles

- **Indigenous Data Sovereignty:**  
  "Data Back" is rooted in the principle of Indigenous Data Sovereignty: the right of Indigenous nations to govern the collection, ownership, and application of their own data. This means Indigenous peoples should control how their data is collected, stored, accessed, and used, in alignment with their values and worldviews.

- **Response to Extractive Practices:**  
  The movement is a reaction against extractive, colonial systems that have historically commodified and profited from Indigenous knowledge, culture, and information-often without consent or benefit to the communities themselves.

- **Cultural Revitalization:**  
  Beyond resistance, "Data Back" inspires the rejuvenation of Indigenous cultures by supporting the protection and revitalization of language, traditions, and knowledge systems through community-controlled data practices.

### Guiding Ethos

> “Nothing about us without us.”

This phrase captures the essence of the movement: Indigenous peoples must be at the center of all decisions about their data. Internationally, this is supported by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Article 31, which affirms the right of Indigenous peoples to maintain, control, protect, and develop their cultural knowledge and data.

### Why It Matters

- **Restoring Authority:**  
  "Data Back" seeks to reverse centuries of data colonialism by restoring authority to Indigenous communities over their information and representation.

- **Ethical Data Governance:**  
  The movement calls for data governance models that prioritize Indigenous consent, benefit, and stewardship, challenging Western-centric and extractive approaches.

- **Community Digital Literacy and Data Privacy:**  
  Teaching digital literacy and data privacy practices is essential to the "Data Back" movement. By equipping community members with the skills to understand, protect, and manage their own data, we empower Indigenous peoples to safeguard their information, resist digital exploitation, and make informed choices about technology. This education helps ensure that data sovereignty is not just a principle, but a lived reality-enabling communities to actively defend their rights and shape their digital futures.

In summary, "Data Back" is about returning control of data to Indigenous peoples, ensuring it is managed, shared, and used on their terms, for their benefit, and in accordance with their cultural values and rights.
