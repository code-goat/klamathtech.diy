## Secure Data Erasure Service – Protecting Your Privacy

Don’t simply bring your old hard drives or computers to the dump-those devices could still contain very important and sensitive personal information. Instead, bring your devices to **Klamath Tech Collective**, where we use ShredOS, a trusted open-source tool, to ensure your data is permanently and securely erased.[^1][^2]

### How the Service Works

- **Step 1: Device Drop-off**  
  Bring your unwanted computers, hard drives, or SSDs to us. We’ll handle the rest.

- **Step 2: Boot and Select Drives**  
  We boot your device using ShredOS from a USB stick or CD. ShredOS is a special operating system designed solely for secure data destruction.[^1][^2]

- **Step 3: Choose Secure Erasure Method**  
  We select the most appropriate erasure method for your device. ShredOS offers up to 10 different wipe techniques, including Department of Defense (DoD) standard multi-pass overwrites, RCMP, Gutmann, and more.[^2][^3]  
  For hard drives, we can use multi-pass overwrites or specialized hardware commands like *Sanitize* or *Security Erase* for maximum effectiveness.[^3][^4]

- **Step 4: Data Overwrite and Verification**  
  The selected method overwrites every sector of your drive, making data recovery impossible. ShredOS also verifies that the wipe was successful by checking for any remaining data.[^1][^3]

- **Step 5: Certificate of Erasure**  
  Once complete, we provide you with a PDF certificate detailing the drive wiped, the method used, and confirmation that the process was successful.[^2]

### Why Trust Us?

- **Open Source & Transparent:** We use ShredOS, a widely recognized open-source tool, so you know exactly how your data is being handled.[^1][^2][^5]  
- **No Data Leaves Your Sight:** All erasures are performed at our community workspace or in your presence.  
- **Certified Results:** You receive documentation for your records and peace of mind.
