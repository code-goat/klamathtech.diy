# 🛡️ Community Workshop: Digital Self Defense

## Protect Your Digital Life, Empower Your Community

In a world where our personal data and communications are constantly under threat, **digital self-defense** is more crucial than ever. Join the Klamath Tech Collective for a hands-on workshop designed to equip you with practical skills to protect your privacy, secure your devices, and reclaim control over your digital presence.

Rooted in the spirit of bioregional resilience and community sovereignty, this workshop is for everyone-from tech novices to seasoned hackers. Our goal is to come together as a community and collectively elevate **all** our skills. Our workshops are for all who wants to learn how to defend themselves online against surveillance, data exploitation, and digital intrusion.

### What You’ll Learn:
- **Basic digital self defense:** Password management, secure browsing, and recognizing phishing/scam attempts
- **Encrypted communications:** How to use tools like Signal and other secure messaging apps
- **Device security:** Protecting your smartphone, laptop, and other devices from hacking
- **Data sovereignty:** Understanding your rights and how to keep your data in your hands
- **Community tech resources:** How to get involved with local mesh networks, open-source projects, and hardware clinics


## Why Join Us?

The Klamath Tech Collective is a community-rooted initiative working across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories to build community-owned tech ecosystems that resist technofeudalism and foster liberation through technology.

By learning digital self-defense, you’re not just protecting yourself-you’re strengthening our collective resilience and ensuring technology serves us and our bioregion, not corporate or state powers.
