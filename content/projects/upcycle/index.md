## Reclaiming Old Tech in the Klamath Bioregion

**UpRiv|Upcycle** is the Klamath Tech Collective’s initiative to intercept and upcycle e-waste-unused, upgraded, or unsupported computers-*before* they end up in the landfill. We’re actively seeking **partnerships with regional organizations, schools, and businesses** to help us collect and reclaim valuable hardware that would otherwise go to waste.

## We Need Your Help: Donate Hardware & Partner With Us!

- **Are you an organization, school, or business with unused computers or laptops?**  
  Let’s work together! We want to partner with you to intercept e-waste and ensure your old tech gets a second life serving the community.

- **Have a computer or laptop from 2012 or newer?**  
  Donate it to us! Your old tech can become a vital resource for someone in the Klamath bioregion.

## Why Upcycle with Us?

- **Secure Data Erasure**  
  We guarantee industry-standard data erasure using tools like *shredOS* and degaussing, so your personal or organizational data is wiped far more securely than simply dropping a computer at the dump.
[Click Here]({{< ref "/projects/secure-shred/" >}}) for more information about our secure data removal.

- **Community-Owned Infrastructure**  
  Donated computers (2012 and newer) are refurbished and repurposed to power community infrastructure-think local servers, shared internet access, and collaborative digital tools managed by and for the Klamath bioregion.

- **Free & Low-Cost Laptop Distribution**  
  We distribute refurbished laptops at no or low cost to individuals, families, and organizations who need them most, closing the digital divide and supporting digital inclusion.

- **Environmental Impact**  
  By intercepting e-waste, we reduce landfill burden, conserve resources, and help the Klamath region meet sustainability goals.

## What We Do

- **Partner with schools, businesses, and nonprofits** to collect unused or outdated computers and tech.
- **Accept donations of laptops, desktops, and servers from 2012 to present**-these devices are perfect for running modern, efficient Linux operating systems.
- **Provide secure, certified data destruction** for all donated devices.
- **Refurbish and reimagine hardware** for use in local community projects:  
  - Community Wi-Fi and internet access points  
  - Local cloud storage and collaborative workspaces  
  - Educational tech labs and digital literacy programs
- **Distribute laptops and desktops** to those in need, supporting education, employment, and access to information.

## Why Now?

With Windows 10 support ending in 2025 and many older computers unable to upgrade to Windows 11, thousands of perfectly usable devices are at risk of being trashed. Most of these machines run Linux beautifully and can continue serving the community for years to come. This is our moment to act-let’s reclaim, upcycle, and empower the Klamath bioregion together.
