# Klamath River Tech Collective  
{{< lead >}} ### *Rooted in Bioregional Resistance, Wired for Liberation*{{< /lead >}}

**We are salmon swimming upstream** against the currents of technofeudalism. Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories—Happy Camp to Hoopa, Somes Bar to Kepel—we're building ```community-owned tech ecosystems``` where the Klamath meets the keyboard.

## Our Currents Flow Through  
- **🛠️ Bioregional Hacktivism**: Makers, open-source collective infrastructure, and solar-powered mesh networks on mountain tops
- **📡 Signal Reclamation**: DIY tech projects, encrypted comms for data sovereignty, and low-earth-orbit satellite ground stations  
- **♻️ E-Waste Revival**: "Mend & Defend" hardware clinics turning old smartphones and forgotten laptops into functional and useful community tools   
- **🌱 STEAM from the Ground Up**: Youth-led soldering circles under the sugar pines, augmented reality language apps for Karuk verbs, and mycelium-based circuit boards

## We Resist By  
- Teaching Tor routing alongside traditional basket weaving patterns  
- Mapping fiber optic deserts as diligently as salmon habitat  
- Coding watershed defense bots while monitoring algal blooms  
- Rejecting AI overlords in favor of ancestral intelligence networks

## Our Toolshed Includes  
```
# Feminist server stacks running on microhydro power  
$ sudo apt-get install community-accountability  
# Salmon-safe cryptography (GPG keys + huckleberry ink)  
$ git clone https://github.com/river-defenders/anti-extractivist-firewall  
# Mycorrhizal learning networks (both silicon and fungal)  
```

## Join the Digital Potlatch  
We gather where:  
- **📻 Airwaves** carry both NDN humor and SSH keys  
- **💻 Old Game Boys** become GPS units for basket materials mapping  
- **🌲 Understory** wifi meshes better than Starlink's cold gaze  

**Find us:**  
- **🌉** At the Orleans Maker Space next to the salmon smokehouse  
- **⛰️** Debugging climate models in Happy Camp's former gold dredge  
- **🌊** Printing river-camera housings from Kepel's recycled fishing gear

**Wana chinuk?** (Karuk: *Are you ready?*)  
Let's build fire-hardened routers and flood-resilient code.
