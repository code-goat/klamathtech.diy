{{< lead >}} # *Rooted in Bioregional Resilience, Wired for Liberation*{{< /lead >}}

**We are salmon swimming upstream** against the currents of technofeudalism. Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories—Happy Camp to Hoopa, Somes Bar to Kepel—we're building ```community-owned tech ecosystems``` where the Klamath meets the keyboard.

## Our Currents Flow Through
- **🛠️ Bioregional Hacktivism**: Free & Open-source collectively built infrastructure, community organized workshops/trainings
- **📡 Signal Reclamation**: Encrypted comms for data sovereignty, and solar-powered mesh networks on mountain tops
- **♻️ E-Waste Revival**: "Mend & Defend" hardware clinics turning old smartphones and forgotten laptops into functional and useful community tools
- **🌱 STEAM from the Ground Up**: Youth-led projects!

---

## We Resist By
- Teaching digital self-defense and privacy skills to every neighbor, auntie, and uncle.
- Returning technology to its rightful place: **as a tool for us, not a tool over us.**
- Coding for bioregional and cultural resilience, not for profit.
- Owning our means of production- **community-owned media** broadcasting from the riverbanks to the mountain-tops, not the boardrooms.
- Rejecting AI overlords in favor of ancestral intelligence networks--because wisdom is grown and shared, not calculated.
