{{< lead >}} # *Rooted in Bioregional Resilience, Wired for Liberation*{{< /lead >}}

Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories‚ÄîHappy Camp to Hoopa, Somes Bar to Kepel‚Äîwe're building ```community-owned tech ecosystems```.

The **Klamath Tech Collective** is a sprouting bioregional tech collective dedicated to shrinking the tech literacy gap and reclaiming technology as a tool for community resilience, self-determination, and regeneration. Our mission is rooted in the belief that technology should serve the people and the land, not extract from them.

We need you! The Klamath Tech Collective thrives on every new ideas and hands-on action, but we can‚Äôt build a real community-scale DIY movement without more people of all ages jumping in. If you want to make tech accessible, creative, and truly community-powered, join us‚Äîyour energy and voice are essential!

## Our Currents Flow Through
- **üõ†Ô∏è Bioregional Hacktivism**: Free & Open-source collectively built infrastructure, community organized workshops/trainings
- **üì° Signal Reclamation**: Encrypted comms for data sovereignty, and solar-powered mesh networks on mountain tops
- **‚ôªÔ∏è E-Waste Revival**: "UpRiv|Upcycle" hardware clinics turning old computer hardware, smartphones and forgotten laptops into functional and useful community tools
- **üå± STEAM from the Ground Up**: Youth-led projects using Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math to foster change

## We Resist By
- Teaching **digital self-defense** and privacy skills to every neighbor, auntie, and uncle.
- Returning technology to its rightful place: **as a tool for us, not a tool over us.**
- Coding for bioregional and cultural resilience, not for profit or extraction.
- Owning our means of production- **community-owned media** broadcasting from the riverbanks to the mountain-tops.
- Rejecting AI overlords in favor of ancestral intelligence networks--because **wisdom is grown and shared, not calculated.**
