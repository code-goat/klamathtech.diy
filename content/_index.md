{{< lead >}} # *Rooted in Bioregional Resilience, Wired for Liberation*{{< /lead >}}

Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories‚ÄîHappy Camp to Hoopa, Somes Bar to Kepel‚Äîwe're building ```community-owned tech ecosystems```.

The **Klamath Tech Collective** is a sprouting bioregional tech collective dedicated to shrinking the tech literacy gap and reclaiming technology as a tool for community resilience, self-determination, and regeneration. Our mission is rooted in the belief that technology should serve the people and the land, not extract from them.

## Our Currents Flow Through
- **üõ†Ô∏è Bioregional Hacktivism**: Free & Open-source collectively built infrastructure, community organized workshops/trainings
- **üì° Signal Reclamation**: Encrypted comms for data sovereignty, and solar-powered mesh networks on mountain tops
- **‚ôªÔ∏è E-Waste Revival**: "UpRiv|Upcycle" hardware clinics turning old computer hardware, smartphones and forgotten laptops into functional and useful community tools
- **üå± STEAM from the Ground Up**: Youth-led projects using Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math to foster change

## We Resist By
- Teaching **digital self-defense** and privacy skills to every neighbor, auntie, and uncle.
- Returning technology to its rightful place: **as a tool for us, not a tool over us.**
- Coding for bioregional and cultural resilience, not for profit or extraction.
- Owning our means of production- **community-owned media** broadcasting from the riverbanks to the mountain-tops.
- Rejecting AI overlords in favor of ancestral intelligence networks--because **wisdom is grown and shared, not calculated.**
