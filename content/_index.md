# Klamath River Tech Collective  
{{< lead >}} ### *Rooted in Bioregional Resistance, Wired for Liberation*{{< /lead >}}

**We are salmon swimming upstream** against the currents of technofeudalism. Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories—Happy Camp to Hoopa, Somes Bar to Kepel—we're building ```community-owned tech ecosystems``` where the Klamath meets the keyboard.

## Our Currents Flow Through  
- **🛠️ Bioregional Hacktivism**: Free & Open-source collectively built infrastructure, community organized workshops/trainings
- **📡 Signal Reclamation**: Encrypted comms for data sovereignty, and solar-powered mesh networks on mountain tops  
- **♻️ E-Waste Revival**: "Mend & Defend" hardware clinics turning old smartphones and forgotten laptops into functional and useful community tools   
- **🌱 STEAM from the Ground Up**: Youth-led projects!

---

## We Resist By  
- Teaching our community members to skills to protect themselves digitally
- Returning technology to it's rightful place: **as a tool for us, rather than us as it's tool**
- Coding for bioregional and cultural resilience
- Owning our means of **Media** production
- Rejecting AI overlords in favor of ancestral intelligence networks

## Join Us!
We gather where:  
- **📻 Airwaves** carry both music and SSH keys  
- **💻 Old Cellphones** become GPS mesh units for basket materials mapping  
- **🌲 Understorys** wifi meshes better than Starlink's cold gaze  

**Find us:**  
- **🌉** ...Coding automation metrics for our smokehouses  
- **⛰️** Debugging environmental models in the high country...  
- **🌊** 3D Printing hunting and fishing gear for our families
