-------
We are salmon swimming upstream against the currents of technofeudalism. Based across ancestral Karuk, Yurok, and Hupa territories -- From Happy Camp to Hoopa, from Somes Bar to Kepel -- we’re building community-owned tech ecosystems where the Klamath meets the keyboard.

**Klamath Tech Collective** is a bioregional tech collective dedicated to shrinking the tech literacy gap and reclaiming technology as a tool for community resilience, self-determination, and regeneration. Our mission is rooted in the belief that technology should serve the people and the land, not extract from them.

### What We Do

- **Tech Literacy & STEAM Education:**  
  We offer free, hands-on workshops and learning circles for all ages, with a focus on STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Math) content that is place-based and culturally relevant. Our programs center Indigenous knowledge and community co-design, empowering youth and elders alike to become creators-not just consumers-of technology.

- **Repurposing & Redistribution:**  
  We collect, repair, and repurpose tech hardware, distributing it freely to individuals and for building collective infrastructure. By keeping devices in use and out of landfills, we support local resilience and reduce reliance on extractive supply chains.

- **Decolonial Tech & Data Ethics:**  
  Our approach is grounded in a strong non-extractive, “data back” ethic. We promote equal access, local control, and citizen/Indigenous-owned science. We teach digital defense and privacy skills to help elders and community members protect themselves from scams, corporate surveillance, and identity theft.

- **DIY & FOSS Culture:**  
  We champion DIY repair, open-source software (FOSS), and community-driven solutions. Our collective is a hub for learning Linux, building digital autonomy, and demystifying AI-helping our region move beyond hype and toward genuine empowerment.

- **Community Debunking & Digital Defense:**  
  We provide a safe space for critical conversations around technology, AI, and digital rights. Our workshops and resources help community members spot misinformation, understand risks, and make informed choices about the tech in their lives.

### Our Values

- **Bioregional Stewardship:**  
  We believe the bioregion is the natural scale for collective action and governance, aligning technology with the needs of our land and people.

- **Intergenerational Learning:**  
  We foster relationships between youth, elders, and all community members, centering Indigenous ways of knowing and ensuring everyone has a voice in shaping our digital future.

- **Collective Power:**  
  We work to build local infrastructure and knowledge that liberates our communities from corporate and colonial control, nurturing a new generation of tech stewards and citizen scientists.

Join us as we weave together ancestral wisdom and modern tools, forging a path toward digital sovereignty and bioregional resilience-where technology flows with, not against, the river.
